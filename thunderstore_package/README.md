# Move While Aiming

Allows Link to move with the analog while aiming in first-person.
While active, the N64 analog input (left stick by default) will be used to move Link.
Aiming will be handled by the right-stick, overriding it's usual behavior.
Does not apply to shooting galleries, or Mini-games where Link should not be able to move around.

Also allows Link to control Epona while aiming with the bow.

Future versions will include an alternate firing button for use with Epona and the Honey and Darling 3rd Day
minigame, since those are a little awkward with the default control scheme.
