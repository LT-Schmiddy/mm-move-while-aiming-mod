# Move While Aiming

Allows Link to move with the analog while aiming in first-person.
While active, the N64 analog input (left stick by default) will be used to move Link.
Aiming will be handled by the right-stick, overriding it's usual behavior.

Does not apply to shooting galleries, or Mini-games where Link should not be able to move around.

Also allows Link to control Epona while aiming with the bow.

This mod now also includes the optional ability for Link to fire the Bow and Hookshot with the R button,
a valuable QoL improvement for when both thumbs are needed for simultaneous aiming and firing. This feature
Will come to the Zora Boomerangs and Deku Bubble in a future version.
